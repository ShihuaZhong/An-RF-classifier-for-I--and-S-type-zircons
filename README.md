This repository contains data and source code used in the publications [“A thickened crustal feature supports Earth’s earliest felsic crust formed in a continental arc-like setting”]. All code by the authors is released under a license. 

CONTENTS:
Data: This directory contains a compiled I- and S-type zircon REE dataset for training and testing, as well as the compiled Jack Hills zircon REE dataset for predicting. The I- and S-type zircon REE dataset includes 12 characteristic elements (Ce, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu) and is provided in a csv format (Zircons.csv). The JH 
Zircon dataset also includes 12 elements and provided in a csv format (X_pred.csv). The reference sources of all these data can be found in online SI Appendix of this paper. 

Code: This directory contains a program in python format. The program includes three parts: parameter optimization, dataset training, and prediction of zircon types.

INSTALLATION:

To use the included python code, you can directly double-click the python file. Then modify the path of the corresponding data set and click Run to get the prediction result.
